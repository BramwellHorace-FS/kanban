# DWS2 Kanban Board
This month, I am working on a new Kanban board application. Throughout this month, I will be working on specific parts  of the application until it is complete with some core functionalities. 

## Milestone 1 

For the first milestone, I began working on the project by writing the static HTML, and creating the foundational styles for the application. 


## Milestone 2

For the second milestone, I added interactivity, connecting the static HTML and SCSS to the API with javascript.
